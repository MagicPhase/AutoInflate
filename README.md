# Enclosure Hardware
This section outlines the necessary 3D-printed pieces to make and assemble a completed unit. Before printing these parts at home or purchasing from a printing service it's important to note that some parts require specific resin types to ensure proper function.

| Part             | 3D model       | Description/Note  |
| :---             | :---:          | :---             |
| **Top Enclosure**    | ![TOP_small](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/assets/104283546/f1da597a-c376-43cc-988c-610120f8454a) | Due to the complexity it's recommended this part be made of resin vs filament. To ensure this part is impact-resistant I recommend [Siraya Tech Fast ABS-Like](https://siraya.tech/products/fast-abs-like) or equivalent. Other resins can be used, but beware of the brittleness and impact resistance of the resin. [OBJ](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/blob/main/3D%20FILES/OBJ/TOP.obj), [STL](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/blob/main/3D%20FILES/STL/TOP.stl)|
| **Bottom Enclosure**| ![BOTTOM_Small](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/assets/104283546/ec3b04cf-c9ef-460c-b619-cdc3b6b00fc4) | This piece is less complex than the top and could possibly be printed in PLA, PETG, or TPU filament. Print orientation may be critical however to ensure the PCB mounting points and index pins are correctly positioned and flat. For the best results, I recommend this part also be resin printed in [Siraya Tech Fast ABS-Like](https://siraya.tech/products/fast-abs-like) or equivalent impact-resistant resin. [OBJ](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/blob/main/3D%20FILES/OBJ/BOTTOM.obj), [STL](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/blob/main/3D%20FILES/STL/BOTTOM.stl)|
| **Pump Shock Mount** | ![MOTOR_MOUNT_Small](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/assets/104283546/b383ccc7-09ab-4c01-bda6-5436b8636461) | Shock mount for the pump motor. This piece is ***optional*** to dampen the pump noise during operation, but it's highly recommended! While it's possible to simply zip-tie the pump to the PCB with some foam padding, during operation, this can transfer a large amount of noise and vibration to the unit. There is an option to reduce pump output to limit the noise level, but this shock mount reduced the overall noise by more than half. The walls of the band are <0.8mm for reference. It's possible to have this part filament-printed with PETG or TPU on the vertical axis, but it's also recommended to have this resin printed with [Siraya Tech Fast ABS-Like](https://siraya.tech/products/fast-abs-like), [Siraya Tech Tenacious -Flexible](https://siraya.tech/products/tenacious-resin-flexible-resin), or equivalent flexible resin. This part can be delicate to handle due to the thinnest part being <0.8mm. [OBJ](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/blob/main/3D%20FILES/OBJ/MOTOR%20MOUNT.obj), [STL](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/blob/main/3D%20FILES/STL/MOTOR%20MOUNT.stl)|
| **EStop Button** | ![ESTOP_Small](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/assets/104283546/de68856c-0f21-4f2a-8909-5ee8ffa0c439) | This is the EStop button that rests on the EStop switch on the PCB. It protrudes through the PCB with 4 guide pins. These pins are <2mm in diamater. This part could possibly be filament printed, ***however***, due to filament prints having ridges, this might make the guide pins rub and stick to the PCB and interfere with the button press. Because of this, it's recommended this part be printed in a non-brittle red-colored resin. [OBJ](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/blob/main/3D%20FILES/OBJ/BUTTON.obj), [STL](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/blob/main/3D%20FILES/STL/BUTTON.stl)|
| **EStop Light Pipe** *Optional*| ![EStop_Light_Pipe_Small](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/assets/104283546/0eb6573c-6805-4a6a-8057-f39b7f6dbb7c) | This light pipe is an optional part that transfers the red EStop light from the PCB to the top of the enclosure. During testing, however, the light also illuminates the EStop button itself and may not be required. Because of its size, this needs to be resin printed in any clear or white resin. [OBJ](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/blob/main/3D%20FILES/OBJ/ESTOP%20LightPipe.obj), [STL](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/blob/main/3D%20FILES/STL/ESTOP%20LightPipe.stl)|
| **Indicator Light Pipe** | ![INDICATOR_LIGHT_PIPE_Small](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/assets/104283546/652ea873-5c42-4cdb-b142-00a91793a03c) | This part is cosmetic and transfers the light from the two RGB LEDs on the top part of the enclosure. This can be printed in resin and possibly filament in either clear or white. [OBJ](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/blob/main/3D%20FILES/OBJ/LIGHT%20PIPE.obj), [STL](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/blob/main/3D%20FILES/STL/LIGHT%20PIPE.stl)|

# Pressure Sensor Manifold Options
One of the two options ***must*** be decided before finishing a BOM list.

| **Manifold Cap** |![MANIFOLD_V0 4_Small](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/assets/104283546/f9f95ea1-2fd5-4d0a-b8c6-5757df42e120)|![MANIFOLD_V0 4_ASSEMBLE_Small](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/assets/104283546/b413e2d8-b140-45f0-bf00-3f64f117314f)|This manifold is required for the [MS583702BA01](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/te-connectivity-measurement-specialties/MS583702BA01-50/6221400) sensor. It's intended to cover the SMD sensor itself and sealed to the PCB with an O-Ring and M2 screws and nuts. It connects the pump, solenoid, and port, and requires a quality resin print to ensure an air-tight seal around the O-Ring and PCB. I recommend [Siraya Tech Fast ABS-Like](https://siraya.tech/products/fast-abs-like) or equivalent. Current version is V0.5. [OBJ](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/blob/main/3D%20FILES/OBJ/Air%20Manifold%20V0.5.obj), [STL](https://github.com/MagicPhase/AutoInflate/blob/main/3D%20FILES/STL/Air%20Manifold%20V0.5.stl)|

This is a cheaper alternative and can be found on Amazon for a few dollars. This manifold is a 4-way that connects the pump, solenoid, sensor, and port, and requires a quality resin print is ensure an air-tight seal around the ports. I recommened [Siraya Tech Fast ABS-Like](https://siraya.tech/products/fast-abs-like) or equivalent.  It is secured with M2 screws. Current version is V0.2.
